# Android Demo Project for Recruitment Purpose

This project is a small demo about my coding skills. 


## Specs

The activity in this example lists places fetched from a REST API and presents it to
the user, once a button is clicked.

### Things I have kept in mind while developing the solution

* Testability
* Dependencies
* Separation of responsibilities
* Readability
* Maintainability


### Technologies used

* Kotlin
* MVVM Architecture with Databinding
* Retrofit for REST API calls
* Kotlin Coroutines for background work
* Dagger 2 for Dependency Injection
* Koin for Dependency Injection(Check separate branch)
* AndroidX and Mockk.io for Unit Testing
